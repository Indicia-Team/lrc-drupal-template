Setting up a new survey on the warehouse
========================================

Firstly, note that in Indicia’s terminology a survey is a dataset owned by one online
recording website which has been set up with a specific structure, a bit like setting up
the columns in a spreadsheet. As well as being used to categorise records, an important
use of surveys in Indicia is to allow you to customise the information you will capture
for a record at a survey level. For example, you might run a survey of hedgehogs in your
area as well as a survey of garden birds. The garden bird survey could allow the user to
tick a box for nesting birds as opposed to non-breeding visitors to the garden. Obviously
it would not make sense to provide this checkbox on a form for inputting hedgehog records!
Don’t worry about dividing your data up into several surveys if you need to in order to
get the right attributes for each survey, as it is simple to join the data back together
again when producing reports and maps later. Whilst we are on the topic of terminology, we
will be using the following: 

* **record** or **occurrence** describes a unique observation of a species on a specified 
  date, at a specified place, by a specified person(s).
* **sample** describes the observation event that leads to the taking of zero or more 
  occurrences, e.g. the use of a trap on a particular date by a particular person(s) at a 
  particular place.
* **location** describes any named place which you are keeping details of in the system. A
  location may be a site that you visit for recording purposes, but could also be 
  something like a town or other place name.
  
Follow these steps to register a new survey for recording on the warehouse.

#. Login to the warehouse using your warehouse login. 
#. Select **Lookup lists** > **Surveys** from the warehouse’s menu. You should now be on a 
   page that shows a grid of surveys that already exist. Note that because your login only
   has access to configure surveys and other information for your own website, you will 
   only see the survey that is already linked to your website.
#. Click the **New survey** button. This takes you to the **New Survey** page.
#. Set the title for your survey to "Spot the amphibian" and optionally fill in the
   description. 
#. Select your website in the **Website** drop down, to associate the survey with your
   own website registration.
