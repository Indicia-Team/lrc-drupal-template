Configuring online recording
############################

The **LRC Drupal Template** website is provided with 2 wildlife recording forms under the
**Wildlife recording** menu, one optimised for single record submissions and one for
multi-record submissions. You can add new recording forms to your website as and when
required. The following tutorials show you how to do this and in the process you'll pick
up many of the basic skills you'll require to get confident with configuring Indicia
recording. 

In this example, we'll add a simple "Spot the amphibian" citizen science survey. You will
need a login for the Indicia warehouse which should have been provided to you.
