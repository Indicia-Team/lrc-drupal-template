Site information
================

An important step in the setup of our website is to provide basic site information such
as the name of the site. Click on **Configuration** in the **admin toolbar** then select
the **Site information** link from the **System** section on the right. Fill in the 
following settings:

* **Site name** - the name of your site, which will generally appear in the header area
  of every page.
* **Slogan** - only needed if you want a "strapline" under your site name.
* **Email address** - provide the email address that any emails sent out by your website
  will come from, e.g. those sent out during the account registration process. It is
  vital that *this email address is from the same domain as the main site* otherwise 
  emails are likely to be treated as spam. Generally you do not need to allow users to 
  reply to these emails, so it doesn't matter if it is actually a real monitored email 
  address. Therefore if your site address is ``http://www.example.com`` then a good email
  address might be ``noreply@example.com``.
  
Other settings on this page can be left as they are at the moment. Save the configuration
when you are done.
