Theming
=======

One of the key features of a content management system such as Drupal is that you can 
control the appearance of the entire site using an easily switchable theme. Site banner,
fonts, colours and positions of various components are all controlled using the theme.
This approach is a vast improvement over static HTML websites where a change to the site's
page structure requires every page of the site to be edited.

The LRC Drupal Template is provided with a purpose built theme called **indiciatheme**.
This theme has the following features:

* Supports changing the site colour scheme, fonts and many other settings via 
  configuration rather than code.
* Built in support for customising the header/banner images.
* Responsive so it works well on everything from a smartphone to a desktop monitor.
* Some built in styles help it to work well with Indicia online recording.

Having said all this, don't forget that you can install a different Drupal theme selected
from `drupal.org <https://drupal.org/project/project_theme>`_ or if you are feeling brave,
`write your own <https://drupal.org/documentation/theme>`_. We'll stick to customising the
**indiciatheme** for now as there are plenty of online resources for Drupal theming in
general when you are ready.
